# open source chili 

It’s time again for IT Oakbrook’s Chili Cook-off and Dessert Bake-off! Why not make an opensource chili recipe? I'll post the recipe here the day of the competition, for anyone who wants to fork it...or spoon it

Chili


* Chili paste 
4 dried ancho chile peppers
4 dried New Mexico chilis
2 T cumin seeds
3 T mexican oregano
1/2 cup water

Roast chilis in oven at 450*, toast cumin seeds in dry pan until a nutty aroma fills the air; Place all ingredients in food processor or spice grander and pulverize to powder. Add water and stir to form paste. Set aside until needed.

8 slices BACON
4 lbs chuck roast cut into 1" cubes
4 T kosher salt
1 med onion
5 cloves garlic
5 small jalapenos chili peppers
2 serrano chili peppers (for additional heat, use 2 habanero peppers)
1 lime
1 C canned crushed tomatoes
7 C water
5 T masa harina

Season chuck roast with kosher salt; set aside. Cook BACON over medium heat until brown and crispy, cut into small pieces (can cut into pieces, then brown). Reserve BACON fat. Put 3 t bacon fat into pan. Working in small batches sear the chuck roast on all sides. Add 3 t BACON fat between batches. Saute onions 4-5 mins, add garlic and jalapenos, saute 2-3 mins. Add chili paste and saute until fragrant and shiney. Add juice from lime and crushed tomatoes. Add 7 cups of water, simmer at least 2 hours (the longer the better) stirring occasionaly. Mix masa harina with 1/2-2/3 cup water to form a thin paste. Add to chili and turn heat to medium to bring to low boil. Can be served with cut limes, sour cream, cilantro, crackers, cheddar cheese, jalapenos, corn bread, tortillas or any other of your favorite toppings.
